We present a curriculum for a diversity-promoting professional
development course for future college instructors. Our diverse inter-disciplinary team of educators developed and implemented the
curriculum in both in-person and online formats. Weekly class meetings
focused on activities and discussions of teaching practices that
encourage and support the increasingly diverse student body in higher
education. Topics included understanding the dimensions of diversity,
practicing strategies to prevent and mitigate microaggressions in real time, reviewing
pedagological approaches to support inclusivity, and exploring data and
research to support classroom practices. By targeting our feasible and acceptable curriculum at
current graduate students who wish to become professors, we aim to
effect institutional change over many years. We conclude the
presentation with lessons learned and future directions.
