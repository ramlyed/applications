We present a curriculum for a diversity-promoting professional
development course for future college instructors. We implemented the
curriculum in both in-person and online formats. Weekly class meetings
focused on activities and discussions of teaching practices that
encourage and support the increasingly diverse student body in higher
education. Activities included teaching of strategies to combat
microaggressions in real time. By targeting our classes at current
graduate students who wish to become professors, we aim to effect
institutional change over many years. We conclude the presentation with
lessons learned and future directions.
